# Churn-Predictor
Trains data on customer churning history and predicts possible future churns

### Steps
1. Clone the data using the command:
- **html: `git clone https://github.com/Prof-Awing/Churn-Predictor.git`**
- **GitHub CLI: `gh repo clone Prof-Awing/Churn-Predictor`**

3. Install dependencies:
```
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Churn Analysis
You can visualize how the columns and their data are related to churn. You can also have an understanding on how the data are distributed in each column.

### Churn model
We have provided two models, one is Random Forest and the other is XGBoost, for classified prediction of churning.
